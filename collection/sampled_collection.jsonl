While math functions can be far more complex than this, most are simple relative to functions used in computer programming.

Price will be equal to 10 if quantity is equal to 0. As quantity rises, we see that price will go down. Eventually as quantity equals 5, we see that the price will be 0. Price functions can also be called inverse demand functions. This is because a demand function has quantity as a function of price, but through simple algebra, we can solve for p to get the price function.

In the illustration below, we can see subscripts and superscripts. The superscripts 1, 2 and 3 written before H are the atomic masses of the isotopes of hydrogen and the subscript 1 is the atomic number.ritium (hydrogen-3), has an atomic mass of 3.0160492, and it consists of one proton and two neutrons. Its nucleus is triple the mass of protium. What distinguishes tritium from protium and deuterium is that it is radioactive, which means that its nucleus is unstable so its nucleus decays and emits radiation."}

{"id": "2176859", "contents": "Ice melts when heat energy causes the molecules to move faster, breaking the hydrogen bonds between molecules to form liquid water. In the melting process, the water molecules actually absorb energy. This is why an ice cube melts more quickly on the outside and retains its coldness and solidity longer at the center: melting is a cooling process. As more heat is introduced, the ice will continue to melt, and if the temperature exceeds the boiling point, about 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit), more hydrogen bonds between water molecules will break completely, creating water vapor."}
{"id": "659736", "contents": "Quick Answer. The vapor pressure of water is relatively low because it is held together through hydrogen bonds. This means that the molecules in a glass of water do not evaporate from the water very easily, as the molecules are attracted to each other. However, as with most liquids, the vapor pressure of water rises as temperature increases. Continue Reading"}
